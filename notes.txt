REACT - a library which tells us how we can make a web page

-> react-dom - for web apps
-> react-native - for mobile apps

Creating a react app - 

npm - Node Package Manager
npx - Node Package Executor

-> using npx
    
    npx create-react-app basicreact

-> using vite

It bascially installs only the mecessary dependencies making the project light weight 
and also boosts up the server run time.
